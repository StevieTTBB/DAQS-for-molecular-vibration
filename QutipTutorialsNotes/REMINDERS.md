# Here are some reminders about these notes:
* I renamed file names with indexes, such as **1, 2, 3**; these indexes suggest the importance of contents within each file.
* The `1Lecture-0-Introduction-to-QuTip.ipynb` is tedious with additional `markdown` and `code`, since I got so many questions when self-study
those new concepts. I added a series of extended contents involving visualization, which may be far beyond this lecture; but they are highly likely to be
covered by later lectures.
* `1Lecture-1-Jaynes-Cumming-model.ipynb` and `1Lecture-3B-Jaynes-Cumming-model-with-ultrastrong-coupling.ipynb` discuss about JC model
from initial states preparation, time evolution and corresponding visualiztion, etc. These two lectures may quite helpful, if we plan to
use JC model acting as a part of our simuation project.
